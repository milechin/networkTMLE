# Using a Synthesis of Statistical and Mathematical Models to Account for Missing Data in Public Health Research
#   This file provides a class object used to simulate SBP values for those in the non-positive region. There
#   are alterantive ways to implement this procedure. This is simply one implementation (note: it could be made
#   much more efficient).
